\section{The Proposed Multi-Agent Framework}

\subsection{Framework Overview}

Our multi-agent system employs a hierarchical three-layer acceleration architecture designed to achieve sub-second query latency while maintaining high accuracy in large-scale data lake environments. The framework orchestrates five specialized agents through a sophisticated workflow engine built on LangGraph, enabling intelligent collaboration for schema matching and data discovery tasks.

    \caption{Three-Layer Acceleration Architecture for Multi-Agent Data Lake Discovery}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure*}

The system architecture comprises three distinct acceleration layers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Metadata Filtering Layer}: Performs rapid candidate elimination based on structural features, reducing the search space by over 90\% within milliseconds.
    \item \textbf{Vector Search Layer}: Employs HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing for semantic similarity matching at sub-second scale.
    \item \textbf{LLM Verification Layer}: Conducts precise matching validation through intelligent batch processing and parallel execution.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Agent Design and Responsibilities}

\subsubsection{PlannerAgent: Strategic Orchestrator}

The PlannerAgent serves as the central coordinator, analyzing user queries to determine optimal processing strategies. It implements an intelligent routing mechanism that selects between two primary strategies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bottom-Up Strategy}: Activated for join discovery scenarios requiring precise column-level matching. This strategy initiates with the ColumnDiscoveryAgent for fine-grained analysis.
    \item \textbf{Top-Down Strategy}: Employed for union discovery tasks focusing on semantic table relationships. This approach begins with the TableDiscoveryAgent for holistic table comparison.
\end{itemize}

The agent's decision-making process considers multiple factors including query complexity, available cached results, and historical performance metrics to optimize execution paths dynamically.

\subsubsection{ColumnDiscoveryAgent: Precision Column Matching}

Operating within the Bottom-Up strategy, the ColumnDiscoveryAgent identifies semantically similar columns across the data lake. It leverages a hybrid approach combining:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Lexical similarity analysis using normalized edit distance
    \item Data type compatibility verification
    \item Sample value distribution comparison
    \item Semantic embedding similarity through pre-trained language models
\end{itemize}

The agent maintains a confidence scoring mechanism (0-1 scale) for each column match, enabling downstream aggregation and ranking.

\subsubsection{TableAggregationAgent: Intelligent Score Synthesis}

This agent aggregates column-level matching results into comprehensive table-level scores. The scoring algorithm considers:

\begin{equation}
S_{table} = \alpha \cdot \overline{C}_{match} + \beta \cdot N_{match} + \gamma \cdot W_{key}
\end{equation}

where $\overline{C}_{match}$ represents average column confidence, $N_{match}$ denotes the number of matched columns, and $W_{key}$ indicates the presence of key columns (e.g., primary keys).

\subsubsection{TableDiscoveryAgent: Semantic Table Analysis}

Implementing the Top-Down strategy, this agent performs holistic table similarity assessment through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Table-level semantic embedding generation
    \item Domain classification using unsupervised clustering
    \item Structural similarity measurement
    \item Content-based relevance scoring
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{TableMatchingAgent: Detailed Verification}

The final verification agent conducts comprehensive table-pair analysis, producing detailed column mappings with match types (exact, semantic, approximate) and confidence scores. It employs advanced matching techniques including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hungarian algorithm for optimal column assignment
    \item Distributional similarity metrics
    \item Cross-column dependency analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimization Mechanisms}

\subsubsection{Multi-Level Caching System}

Our framework implements a three-tier caching architecture:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{L1 Cache (Memory)}: Stores frequently accessed embeddings and recent query results with sub-millisecond access time.
    \item \textbf{L2 Cache (Redis)}: Maintains session-persistent intermediate results and metadata indices.
    \item \textbf{L3 Cache (Disk)}: Preserves long-term computational results including pre-computed embeddings and historical matches.
\end{enumerate}

The cache hierarchy achieves over 95\% hit rate for repeated queries, enabling 857Ã— speedup for cached operations.

\subsubsection{Parallel Processing and Batch Optimization}

The system employs sophisticated parallelization strategies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Query-level parallelism}: Supports 10 concurrent query processing threads
    \item \textbf{Batch LLM processing}: Aggregates up to 20 verification requests per API call
    \item \textbf{Asynchronous vector search}: Parallel HNSW queries across distributed indices
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\subsubsection{Datasets}

We evaluate our system using two carefully curated datasets derived from web tables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Subset Dataset}: Contains 100 tables with 502 ground-truth query pairs, designed for rapid prototyping and ablation studies.
    \item \textbf{Complete Dataset}: Comprises 1,534 tables with 7,358 query pairs, representing real-world data lake complexity.
\end{itemize}

Each dataset includes tables with diverse schemas, ranging from 3 to 15 columns, with varied data types and domain coverage including e-commerce, scientific data, and government statistics.

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}

The system is implemented in Python 3.10 using the following key technologies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LLM Integration}: Supports multiple providers (Gemini-2.0-flash, GPT-4, Claude) with configurable model selection
    \item \textbf{Vector Embeddings}: Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic similarity computation
    \item \textbf{Indexing}: FAISS library with HNSW index configuration (M=16, ef\_construction=200)
    \item \textbf{Workflow Engine}: LangGraph 0.5.4 for agent orchestration
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}

We adopt standard information retrieval metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Precision@k}: Fraction of retrieved tables that are relevant within top-k results
    \item \textbf{Recall@k}: Fraction of relevant tables successfully retrieved within top-k results
    \item \textbf{F1-Score}: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
    \item \textbf{Mean Average Precision (MAP)}: Average precision across all recall levels
    \item \textbf{Query Latency}: End-to-end processing time per query
    \item \textbf{Throughput}: Queries processed per second under concurrent load
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ablation Study}

To validate our architectural decisions, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies:

\subsubsection{Impact of Three-Layer Architecture}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Ablation Study: Layer Contributions}
\label{tab:ablation}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}

Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-agent framework for large-scale data lake discovery. The three-layer acceleration architecture successfully balances the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, achieving sub-second query latency while maintaining practical recall rates.

Key findings include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The hierarchical filtering approach effectively reduces computational complexity without sacrificing recall
    \item Multi-agent collaboration enables specialized processing strategies that outperform monolithic approaches
    \item Intelligent caching and batch processing provide significant performance improvements for production deployment
\end{enumerate}

Current limitations include moderate precision (30\%), suggesting opportunities for improvement through enhanced embedding models and refined matching algorithms. Future work will focus on incorporating advanced neural architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to achieve the target 90\% precision while maintaining current efficiency levels.
